\section{Objectives}At the moment, the light duty air compressor market mainly use electricity as the power source, which can be inconvenient at remote locations where power grid is difficult to reach. To solve this problem, we will analyze and model a V-twin air compressor with a compressing end and a combustion end. The model is programmed with MATLAB \textcircled{\textsuperscript{{\tiny R}}}
 

\section{Aim}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Help students understand more clearly about tensile force of some types of steels, the relation between central $ M_k $ and localized strain of material.
	\item Help students approach methods, measuring devices in determining tensile force.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Safety Procedures}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Safeguard is compulsory when straining the bolt.
	\item Close the machine gate when operating.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
Based on the data and graphs, it can be concluded that steel bolts are more durable than common bolts.\\
Through 5 experiments conducted on each type of bolt, we saw that in spite of being the same type, each experiment gave different results, which could be explained from minor dissimilarities in shape and internal structure as a consequence of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Errors during the designing and machining.
	\item Environmental effects from transportation, preservation, climate, etc.
	\item Difference in microscopic level due to manufacturing: defects, varying temperature, mold structure, cooling rate, etc.
	\item Unreliable testing.
\end{itemize}
In summary, we can see that the fracture point of each individual bolt is different but not too much. This feat is achieved by modern and increasingly accurate manufacturing techniques.
