\chapter*{Abstract}
Data acquisition is one of the crucial steps of designing a mechatronic system. Changes in the environment must be observed for decision making purposes.

Sensors can be seen anywhere such as natural or man-made objects. The natural sensors, like those found in living organisms, usually respond with signals having electrochemical character. In man-made devices, information is also transmitted and process in electrical form. Application for sensors is almost limitless, from simple system such as car door monitoring arrangement to extremely complex one like Mars Exploration Rover â€“ B.

Since the topic about sensors is so vast and technical, designing a complex sensor is beyond the scope of this report. Therefore, in our project, we only focus on flow sensor, and specifically how to make the best of the sensor catalog. This goal includes what parameters are important in choosing the right flow sensor for one's project, expected failure modes during operation and maintenance of the sensor, which makes the report somewhat practical in designing the system as a whole.
