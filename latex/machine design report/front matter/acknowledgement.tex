\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
	
	I would like to give a special thank to Prof. Nguyen Tan Tien, my supervisor in this course. I have never written any design report, which makes it a hard task for inexperienced students. Without Prof. Tien's constructive criticism on logical representation of the paper and his instruction on overall design of mechanical elements, this report would not be finished.
	
	I am also thankful for my friends and classmates. They are the readers that give me an objective view on how writing style affects the readability of the entire report.
