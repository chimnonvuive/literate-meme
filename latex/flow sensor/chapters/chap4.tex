\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}

In summary, the report introduces a general list of considerations before deciding to buy a sensor. It also introduces a number of flow sensors available in the market. Since the author's knowledge regarding sensor technology is poor, the report is only limited to studying working principles of simple sensors. However, what is more desired for university students is to acknowledge and appreciate the design of many existing sensors. In addition, knowing how to read datasheets and implement the sensor in designing mechatronic systems is extremely crucial, which is the initial goal of this project.
