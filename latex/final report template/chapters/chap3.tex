\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}

Last chapter. Provide discussions: what should be done/ has been reached; difficulties in the making of this project. Describe logical relation of the previous chapters. (optional) give advice for a reasonable continuation of the project.

During the internship, I had a chance to get acquainted with a new working environment. I have accumulated experience in industry knowledge as well as experience skills above \cite{marghitu_2009_mechanisms}.

I was trained in problem solving skills in many stages, trying to complete the job in the shortest time, boldly exchanging and sharing knowledge. At the same time, it also fosters a lot of knowledge about graphic software as well as programming skills to solve the problems learned in school but professionally and saves more time \cite{li_1984_hng}.

Shortcomings: the skill is not mature which still takes a long time to execute; the ability to think and propose design plans is limited due to the lack of practical experience and in-depth knowledge \cite{li_1984_hng}.

Solution: practice more software skills, add additional specialized knowledge that is lacking.
