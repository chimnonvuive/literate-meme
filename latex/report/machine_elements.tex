	\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
	To complete the internship report topic, first of all I would like to send my sincere thanks and deep gratitude to the lecturers of Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology for providing great opportunities so that I have more time for technical internships. \\
	In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Nguyen Tan Tien, who wholeheartedly guided and helped me complete this internship report topic.\\
	Finally, I also would like to thank my teammates, Nguyen Dang Hung and Nguyen Khanh Trung and the seniors at DCSELab for their help and support.\\
	At the same time, the school has given me the opportunity to practice where I love, let me step into real life to apply the knowledge that my teachers have taught. Through this internship, I realize many new and useful things in the preliminary design of practical machines to help me in my future work.\\
	Due to my lack of knowledge and experience regarding the modeling skills, this report is very likely be prone to mistakes. I am looking forward to your response for future improvements.
